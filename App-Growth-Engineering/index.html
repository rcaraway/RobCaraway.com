<p>Pain is a good teacher.  I learned from my mistakes, improved my processes, and <strong>built and sold a portfolio of apps of 2 million downloads.</strong></p>
<p>Several clients, big and small, have leveraged my skill set to grow their apps in the same way.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>One thing I’ve learned – <strong>we’re all destined to make the same mistakes if we’re not careful.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Trying to avoid waste in your app development starting NOW</li>
<li>Want to work through the path of finding revenue &amp; profits and have only months to work with</li>
<li>Looking for specific step-by-step techniques that have proven to grow apps.</li>
<li>trying to outrun competition that’s exploded onto the scene</li>
</ul>
<p>This typically makes you: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>✅ Entrepreneur with or without an existing audience<br>✅ Early-stage founders &amp; or executive<br>✅ Director of Product/Engineering &amp; Managers who are hoping to expand business through apps</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>If this is you, aim to avoid the same pitfalls as almost everyone by leveraging this guide.</strong></p>
<p>The processes that <em>actually</em> work are often not the things we think will.  We’ll dive into that soon.</p>
<h4 id="Why-should-I-trust-this-book"><a href="#Why-should-I-trust-this-book" class="headerlink" title="Why should I trust this book?"></a><strong>Why should I trust this book?</strong></h4><p>I’m Rob Caraway and I run TrendCraft.  </p>
<p>I’ve:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Built apps from scratch that have over 2 million downloads</strong>  and have been acquired.</li>
<li>Grew a client’s mobile business to seven figures.</li>
<li>Acted as Mobile Lead for several clients including iClicker, HEB, Oracle’s Moat, &amp; Kubota.</li>
<li>Have run hundreds of app experiments and worked across over 10 industries for over a decade</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>This is meant to be <em>professional grade</em> – I attempt to avoid speculation, magic bullets, and focus on specific theory, strategy &amp; tactics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I haven’t gotten to this point without a lot of failures that required a lot of reflection.  We can learn from one of my biggest failures: Valt.  </p>
<h5 id="What-I-learned-from-one-of-my-Biggest-Failures-Valt-–-A-password-management-app"><a href="#What-I-learned-from-one-of-my-Biggest-Failures-Valt-–-A-password-management-app" class="headerlink" title="What I learned from one of my Biggest Failures: Valt – A password management app"></a>What I learned from one of my Biggest Failures: Valt – A password management app</h5><p>Early in my career, a friend mentioned they need a password manager solution.  Looking for ideas, I jumped at the “opportunity” to build her something special. </p>
<p>Excited, I reasearched EVERY current solution available and took note of their problems. I interviewd my friend about her problems a lot.    I read all their bad reviews and thought to myself “I can do this better”.  </p>
<p>I built an app over the next half year that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Had a more attention grabbing app icon</li>
<li>Was a smoother experience.  </li>
<li>Had a prettier website</li>
<li>Looked and functioned better</li>
</ul>
<p>Than any of its competitors.</p>
<p>And yet when I launched it – crickets.   Despite being a “better product” than the competitors, very few people wanted to use it.  </p>
<h6 id="Why-traditional-app-development-doesn’t-work-for-growth"><a href="#Why-traditional-app-development-doesn’t-work-for-growth" class="headerlink" title="Why traditional app development doesn’t work for growth"></a>Why traditional app development doesn’t work for growth</h6><p>We are rolling the dice when we make assumptions.</p>
<p>Yet that’s what we do with every single app idea, feature, design decision and implementation detail.</p>
<p><img src="/pics/chance.png" alt="chance"></p>
<p>With my app Valt, I made a massive amount of devastating assumptions.  The biggest one being that users would want to switch or try an unproven competitors because it “looked prettier”.</p>
<p>But “looked prettier” was also entirely subjective.  </p>
<p>I thought I’d involved enough feedback from “users”, but those users weren’t users and they were telling me what I wanted to hear.  </p>
<p>I hadn’t tested how actual potential customers would actually respond to the app until it was too late.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The more we build before getting into actual users hands, the more we have to test and improve to get it right.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the time I was getting useful customer feedback, by people who ACTUALLY wanted my app to deliver,  it felt like I had to steer a titanic to course correct.  </p>
<p><img src="/pics/failure.png" alt="App Growth Failure"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>✅ The next app I built, GifShare, I spent one week building an mvp and already had over 500 users signed up ready to use it before it even reached the App Store.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>We feel safe because we’ve hired a fantastic team, done hours of research, or even had previous successes that we think will carry over. </p>
<p><em>The worst part</em>: approaching the problem like this <em>feels</em> intuitive.  </p>
<p>But building like this is unfortunately a leap of faith: </p>
<ul>
<li>every single feature you add is an assumption your user will want them</li>
<li>every single UX decision you make is an assumption about behavior</li>
<li>making your app “pretty” is an assumption your users will also find it pretty</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/pics/leap.png" alt="Leap of Faith"></p>
<p>We typically think the risk is not taking time to design a better app with more features than existing competition, but that isn’t true.  </p>
<p><em>So then if this type of building doesn’t work, what will?</em></p>
<h2 id="A-working-theory-of-App-Growth-Engineering"><a href="#A-working-theory-of-App-Growth-Engineering" class="headerlink" title="A working theory of App Growth Engineering"></a>A working theory of App Growth Engineering</h2><blockquote>
<p><mark><strong>App Growth Engineering</strong></mark> is the pursuit of <strong>engineering apps to maximize revenue.</strong> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I make several assertions that combine to create a full picture of engineering App Growth. </p>
<p><em>In order to give ourselves the best chance to maximize revenue, we must:</em> </p>
<h4 id="1-Maximize-the-Quality-of-Ideas-we-work-on"><a href="#1-Maximize-the-Quality-of-Ideas-we-work-on" class="headerlink" title="1. Maximize the Quality of Ideas we work on"></a>1. <em>Maximize the Quality of Ideas we work on</em></h4><blockquote>
<p><em>Theory: For team N &amp; team M, given that each team executes at the same pace, where team N dedicates deliberate time to processes identifying the best ideas to work on and team M chooses ideas with no process, team N is more likely to create sustainable growth than team M.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In practice, despite the management science being there for years, most app teams simply do not dedicate the right amount of time to picking the right ideas. </p>
<p>The tricky part: we get into trouble dedicating TOO much time to picking ideas – therefore, developing quality ideas faster is our goal.</p>
<p>Everytime I’ve failed to do this (like Valt), it’s costs me big time. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Companies like Pinterest, Spotify and more have realized that we need processes that not to be dedicated to not just generating ideas, but:</p>
<ul>
<li>improving the quality of idea generated </li>
<li>improving the selection process of generated ideas</li>
<li>improving buy-in to selected ideas from all stakeholders</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>
<p>We incur risk and spend with every action we take.  </p>
<p>Our hard work and maximized efficiency will mean nothing if we are working on the wrong things, too.</p>
<p>To eliminate these issues, we design experiements (bets) aimed to maximize our chances at working on the highest impact items for our current business situation.  </p>
<p>Our Bets should: </p>
<ul>
<li>Require the least amount of up front work as we can</li>
<li>Target users we believe will have the highest motivation to use at first</li>
<li>Include any risk mitigation strategies (what if those goes horribly wrong?) that would prevent problems a bet <em>might</em> cause</li>
<li>Have a clear benchmark for what success and failure looks like</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><mark>Minimum Viable Product</mark></strong>: taking the quickest sustainable path to validating whether any initiative has a chance of adding business value or not. </p>
<p> An initiative might be a new app, new feature, new tweak or new version.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A key word mentioned above is sustainability. </p>
<p>Our projects will fail long term if we are not carefully considering three things: </p>
<ol>
<li>Our we managing tech debt responsibly?</li>
<li>Does our tech stack and tooling give us a competitive advantage?</li>
<li>Do we have the expertise to deliver the project effectively? </li>
</ol>
<p>Affordable expertise is the number one concern.  Strong experts will know how to manage tech debt and will always be evaluating the tools and tech they use to deliver value.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is <strong><mark>tech debt</mark></strong>? </p>
<p>Tech debt is like real debt – building a solution with code that is designed for speed will often bring us tech debt, while spending time designing software well will pay off tech debt.  </p>
<p>Having some of it is useful (good debt), as it can help you get something to market faster.  </p>
<p>Having too much of it is suffocating and can tank your app business. </p>

Improve business value by measuring and obversing the right metrics"></a>4. <em>Improve business value by measuring and obversing the right metrics</em></h4><p>We’ll never know what’s working and what’s failing if we aren’t measuring the proper things.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Example:</em> we’ve upgraded to a version 2.0 and our revenue has actually <em>decreased</em>!  We aren’t measuring anything however, so we have no choice but to throw out the entire new version :(</p>
<p>In reality, several things of that new version, like onboarding and our core features, actually improve user engagement!  The sales page was just converting poorly.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’ll also think some successes are failures if we’re not measuring the <em>right</em> metrics.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Example:</em> we add a new in app purchase flow and notice over the last week that our revenue has jumped 40%!!  </p>
<p>Great news right?  <em>Well…</em></p>
<p>What the metric didn’t take into consideration is some of the new paying users pissed off a lot of users who now won’t be cancelling and will stop using the app earlier than before.  Overall, this is a net negative on our business. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Growing our app business relies on us knowing how to measure the right metrics and mitigate the consequences of those metrics.</p>
<h4 id="Finally-Go-through-each-stage-with-the-least-amount-of-time-effort-amp-expense"><a href="#Finally-Go-through-each-stage-with-the-least-amount-of-time-effort-amp-expense" class="headerlink" title="Finally, Go through each stage with the least amount of time, effort &amp; expense"></a>Finally, <em>Go through each stage with the least amount of time, effort &amp; expense</em></h4><p>Staying competitive means a regular evaluation of the tools process<br>We should constantly be evaluating if the tools, tech, and processes are helping us stay competitive and move faster.  </p>
<p>We should always be on the lookout for waste and new advances in automation and speed.  </p>
<p>Even the biggest successful bets mean nothing if we aren’t approaching them competitively and sustainably.  </p>
