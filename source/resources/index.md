A huge amount of my education has been self taught.Â  Here's an shallow attempt to quantify that education based on books, talks, blog posts, anything that's helped me get where I am today.

This list isn't exhaustive, but focuses on both the most important resources, and the most currently relevant.


# **On Time Management and Productivity:**



#### [The Power of Full Engagement.](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Full-Engagement-Managing-Performance/dp/0743226755)  
Early in my career I worked long hours till I learned it isn't about working hard, it's about using your energy effectively.  Go out and have some fun, your work life will be better for it.

#### [The Effective Executive](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Executive-Definitive-Harperbusiness-Essentials/dp/0060833459/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1528417009&sr=1-1&keywords=the+effective+executive)
What separates highly effective people is their ability to prioritize the right things.  


#### [The Power of Habit](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business/dp/081298160X/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1528417067&sr=1-3&keywords=the+power+of+habit&dpID=51NzjhIhK0L&preST=_SY344_BO1,204,203,200_QL70_&dpSrc=srch)
